# Movie app interface with Vue.js

A similarly styled movie streaming interface.

App based on [codepen by Hassan Djirdeh](https://codepen.io/itslit/full/MvvjZr) with my little changes (such as splitting into modules and using .vue files) 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
